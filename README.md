This is just another WordPress framework. It is built for developers to create awesome and highly customizable themes for clients or sell it on any marketplace.

## Getting Started

1. You must have latest version of [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Change folder name to your theme name. e.g: `xurais` or `xu-rais`.
3. Navigate to `node_scripts` folder and open `config.json` with your favorite editor.
    - Change `"name"` to your theme name eg: `Xurais` or `Xu Rais`.
    - Change `"proxy"` to your development site url.
    - Change `"global"` to a unique prefix. e.g: `xurais` or `xus`.
    - Change `"build"` to your desired folder path. Your theme will be saved there when you run build command.
5. Open command line, navigate to project folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
6. Now run `npm run init` command to automatically change text-domain, prefixes, DocBlocks etc to your theme name.
7. Run `npm run serve` command to watch your theme files for changes and auto reload browser. ;-)
8. Once you have completed your theme run `npm run build` command to generate a clean copy of your theme. `.pot` file will also be generated inside languages folder.
9. Run `npm run child` to generate child-theme.
10. To stop auto browser reload use `CTRL+C` in windows and `CMD+C` on mac.
